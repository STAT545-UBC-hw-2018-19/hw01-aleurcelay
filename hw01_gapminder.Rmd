## Gapminder Exploration

This is an R Markdown document used for exploring a dataset. In this case I used gapminder.

format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

I included R code to explore the data set:

```{r}
install.packages('gapminder', repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(gapminder)
gapminder
summary(gapminder)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
