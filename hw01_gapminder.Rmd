## Gapminder Exploration :woman_technologist:

This is an R Markdown document used for exploring a dataset using basic R functions. Here I used gapminder data, which includes data on life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population by country.

## R Code

I included R code to explore the data set.


Loading the gapminder dataset afer installing the necessary packages:
```{r include = FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```
```{r include = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r include = FALSE}
install.packages("gapminder", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```
```{r}
library(gapminder)
```


Now, I want to know the class of the data, a summary of it and the first few values to have an idea of which type of data I'm dealing with:
```{r}
class(gapminder)
summary(gapminder)
head(gapminder)
```
I also want to know how big is my data set (number of rows and columns)

```{r}
dim(gapminder)
```
I can also see useful information about my dataset, including the type of data for each column with str() function:
```{r}
str(gapminder)
```
I can summarize information. For example, number of observations and countries per continent:
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(n_obs = n(), n_countries = n_distinct(country))
```

It is also possible to visually compare different data subsets. For example, let's compare the life expentancy between Canada and Mexico:

```{r}
plot(lifeExp ~ year, gapminder, 
     subset = country == "Canada", 
     type = "b", 
     main = "Life Expentancy in Canada", 
     xlab = "", 
     ylab = "Life Expectancy (years)",
     col = "red")
```


```{r}
plot(lifeExp ~ year, gapminder, 
     subset = country == "Mexico", 
     type = "b", 
     main = "Life Expentancy in Mexico", 
     xlab = "", 
     ylab = "Life Expectancy (years)",
     col  = "darkgreen")
```
