## Gapminder Exploration

This is an R Markdown document used for exploring a dataset using basic R functions. Here I used gapminder data, which includes data on life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population by country.

## R Code

I included R code to explore the data set.

First, we need to install the gapminder package:
```{r}
install.packages("gapminder")
```

Loading the gapminder dataset afer installing the package:
```{r}
library(gapminder)
```

Now I want to know the class of the data, a summary of it and the first few values to have an idea of which type of data am I dealing with:
```{r}
class(gapminder)
summary(gapminder)
head(gapminder)
```
n_obs$countries


```{r}
plot(lifeExp ~ year, gapminder, subset = country == "Mexico", type ="b")
```




## Including Plots
```{r}
year <- gapminder[3]
pop <- gapminder[5]

data<- data.frame(year,pop)
plot(data)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
